# ECMAScript coding challenge app

Users get a random JS related challenge every time they visit the app or click "Random" button. They can also create their own challenges for others to solve. 

Challenges are categorized into:
- Fundamentals
- Arrays
- Objects
- Sets
- Maps
- Dates
- RegEx
- Recursion
- Classes
- Errors
- Promises

Each challenge also has a difficulty which is either Easy, Medium or Hard.

Clicking on any of the categories will open a random challenge from that category. Each challenge also contains a set of test cases (minimum one) needed to pass for a successful solution.
